I'm finally wrapping up my rewrite, after 2 months of work, which was a lot longer than I thought. Ultimately I'm glad I did it, as everything feels a lot easier to understand and I'll have a much better time adding new features and fixing bugs moving forward.

It took longer partly because I was also improving things, naturally.

Actually, this was much more than a rewrite, come to think of it. I replaced my own static site generator with Hugo and that took a ton of time. I suppose this is the danger of rewrites. It's never just a rewrite.

If I were to do this sort of thing again I would try to break it up a lot more so that I could merge with production instead of waiting until the very end.

Today I decided to nix a couple of major features which were a bit superfluous and only half-baked from the beginning:
- Standards/objectives
- Assessments

I just commented out the UI for these features and didn't delete any code. Eventually I'll add these back in but it was going to take a good while to implement these fully and I don't really need them right now. With a busy summer coming up and an early start to the Fall 2025 semester (August 1st) I need all the help I can get, so I'm just cutting them out for now.
