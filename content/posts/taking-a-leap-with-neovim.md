+++

I was taking a month-long course where we had to use the school computers instead of our own. I had some down time during breaks and wasn't able to access my personal laptop, so I decided to try to do things in the cloud. This took me a while because the school's Microsoft network just *happened* to block digital ocean and google cloud consoles which I am more familiar with, but fortunately allowed me to access Azure cloud services (weird, right?? Wonder why?). Azure pricing was a bit intimidating but was able to set up the cheapest virtual machine I could find at about $8 a month, more than enough power (1GB RAM) for my purposes. I just wanted to play around in Linux so I could keep learning. I started setting up Vim for Go development and then decided to try out Neovim. Long story short, this led me ultimately to replacing my own setup on my personal machine! I've spent the last couple of weeks getting familiar with this IDE and I have to say it's been a blast. I'm still not as productive as I am with VS Code but maybe I'll get there soon.

More to follow on my Neovim journey, but suffice to say for now, it was not as hard to get started as I thought, with thanks in large part due to LazyVim (a sort of Neovim "distribution").

The moral of this story might be, make the best of every moment; you may get more out of it than you expect!
