I'll transferring to Charlotte Engineering Early College for the 2025-2026 school year.  I'm excited about the move, but I'm also a little sad because I have really enjoyed working at Phillip O. Berry. The students are awesome, my colleagues are awesome, and the admin is awesome.  There is a lot of heart at this school and it will always hold a special place for me.

Mr. Johnny Darling and I plan to continue our new podcast, so please watch out for that here [Charlotte Tech Talks](https://charlotte-tech-talks.org) or on Apple podcasts.

Dr. Gamble is taking my place teaching Python at POB next year, and I can tell you that he is more than capable, as our soon-to-be-published interview with him will show. The software pathway students at POB will be very lucky to have him and Mr. Darling as their computer science instructors, as they bring with them a gigantic wealth of life experience and expertise, in addition to a rare level of commitment and heart.
