## Proposed Change

Make the app course and term calendars show monthly view instead of entire semester with scrolling.

## Summary

The static site calendar is much better than the app side in terms of appearance and ease of use. Need to bring the app side up to speed by using Tailwind calendar template like I did on the static side.
