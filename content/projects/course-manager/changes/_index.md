This change log is mainly to help me keep track of what I've done and what I'm planning to do. I've considered making the application open-source, which would probably mean putting a change log on GitHub along with the code, but I'm not sure about that. So in the meantime, I'm sharing my progress on this work here.

Changes will fall into one of the following categories:

## Type of change
- Bug fix (addressing one of the issues)
- Feature addition

## Change status
- Pending Decision (for features): this means we're currently figuring out whether to implement the feature, including the broad strategy by which to implement it
- Pending Development (for features): this means we're currently working on implementing it
- Released: this has been merged to main
