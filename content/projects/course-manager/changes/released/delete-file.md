# Proposed Change: Add ability to delete files

## Status

Complete

## Summary

There is currently no way on the front end to delete a file.

## Justification

File deletion is a basic requirement of any file system

## Negative Impact

A small amount of time

## Required actions

I believe most of the feature already exists on the back end, and I should just need to add a button and route handler.
