## Pending

<!-- Note: to add issues use snippets with prefixes "major" and "minor" -->

- New course calendar doesn't show at smaller screen sizes (I left out a portion of the tailwind template)
{.major}

- New course calendar buttons don't show text
{.major}

- Need placeholder image for when no user is signed in
{.minor}

- signin page after redirect following token expiration does not seem to render properly under certain circumstances
  - in particular when I clicked Generate from the home page, the signin component was sent but not as a complete page including layout
  - maybe htmx problem not redirect problem
{.major}

- Select lesson to add to date page needs major cosmetic upgrade (functionality is ok)
- Assessments list page UI needs major upgrade (functionality is ok)
- (major) if there's a lesson on 2 dates, bumping that date left or right on the calendar page will bump BOTH instances, not just the one that's clicked on.
- (major) forgot to add ON CASCADE DELETE to assessments.lesson_id column; this means deleting a lesson will give a foriegn key error upon attempting to delete a lesson that has assignments. Which might be ok, but will need to adjust the UI accordingly.
- (major) attempting to view lesson files returns a server error rather than a simple message stating that no files exist for the lesson
- (major) similarly, attempting to view lesson slides returns a server error
- 1/23/25 (minor) Deleting a course (unit, lesson may take a while as well) takes a long time. Maybe after a course row itself is deleted we should go ahead and return the response to the user and do the rest in the background. If child elements and files are not deleted we should log an error but the user doesn't need to wait on all of that, maybe?
- (minor) I think FitToTerm won't respect out of order units or lessons, it will put units and lessons in order using sequence and numbers rather than keeping the order as it was in the previous term.

## Complete

- (major) lesson details: add standards functionality lacking
- (major) show edit node sends the entire page instead of just the edit form, so either change the target or what is sent
- (minor) list the lesson objectives on static site
- (minor) marp server being down (or still starting) shouldn't prevent the lesson details page from loading
- (major) Sync does not seem to work
- (major) Static calendar not displaying data
- No way to delete occasions from term calendar
- (major) under certain conditions, have to generate site a second or third time for slides to show up. suspect there's an issue with the files modification times falsely reporting no changes. Resolved by removing slides.html from data directory. Copying the slides.html in to the static site was causing the html mod time to be later than the markdown mod time. Not sure why it ever worked actually. (Note: I re-added the slides.html to the data directory and removed the slide generation phase from the site generator, and  made sure that every time an edit is made to the slides, the html is regenerated)

- 2/23/25 (major) 405 error (method not allowed) when attempting to post a file to a course. Resolved by adding the necessary functions to handlers/node.go to ensure the route was registered.

- 2/22/25 (major) UpNav to terms list from term calendar leaves user-id param empty. Resolved by (not sure what I did)
- 12/30/24 (minor) Lesson Edit form shows description as single-line with horizontal scroll rather than wrapping text. Resolved by switching from Fyne to web application (lol) 1/8/25
- 1/7/25 (major) Calendar doesn't fit to screen properly. Resolved by switching from Fyne to web application (lol) 1/8/25
- 1/4/25 (major) Shifting lessons across months doesn't show properly in the UI layer, probably because the map isn't updated or something. Going back out and then back into the calendar works though. Problem was I wasn't updating the in-memory Course upon shifting, I was only updating the UI and the DB. Resolved 1/4/24

- 12/30/24 (major) ShowCalendar shows wrong course! Resolved 12/30/24

- 12/26/24 There's a serious problem with how the courses are saved, at least when imported from CSV. I noticed that the calendar for Spring 2025 was showing dates for January but none of the other term months. After some digging I realized that the problem in the "lesson dates" table and how lesson dates are saved.  Basically all I know is that the date_id column in the lesson_dates table consists only of Fall 2024 dates. Resolved 12/26 (new domain.Course method `FitToTerm(term Term) Course` which just sets the dates sequentially for each lesson to dates from the new term, with one date per lesson. After instructional days are exhausted, lesson dates are left empty. Lessons will be visible from course tree but not in course calendar.)

- 12/18/24 Resolved 12/27/24 (see proposal 2): figure out how to relate templates to instances. should the template
id only be present for a row if they are marked by user as synchronized? i.e. until the user marks sync?
  - Proposed solution 1 (rejected): whenever a user edits a course, unit or lesson that is an instance, i.e. where template is NOT NULL, the change should be also be made to the template row (and vice versa). If the user has elected to de-link the course, unit or lesson instance from the template, the change will not be reflected in the template object.
  - Proposed solution 2 (implemented): completely eliminate the entire concept and all implementations of course template as opposed to course instance.
    - There would only be a course, which will always be associated with a term. The fact that the dates table has a day number column will facilitate copying a course from one term to another.  This would be a very big change but the impact would be to dramatically simplify the code.
    - Would probably add the fields currently exclusively found in CourseInstance and move them to Course. Need to identify all parts of the code that depend on a distinction between the two, for example any use of templateID, and alter essential parts and eliminate non-essential ones.
    - Make sure the Database tables reflect this change completely.
- 12/19/24 calendar looks better now
- 12/17/24 lesson struct should have Date field be Dates []time.Time instead of Date time.Time so that a lesson can span multiple dates if necessary (not ideal but sometimes necessary) (completed 12/17/24)
